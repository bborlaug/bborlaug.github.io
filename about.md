Hello! I'm a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory where I support data-driven analyses on the topics of vehicle electrification, automation, and shared mobility solutions, especially with regards to their respective energy impacts. I'm also a data enthusiast and advocate of analytic transparency (open source and open data with an emphasis on reproduceability).   

This portfolio serves as an aggregator for all the content that I've published online regarding data projects that I've conducted over the years. Most projects were completed in my own time at my own interest to serve the purpose of satisfying a curiosity or as an excuse to learn/practice a technique or technology that is interesting to me.
